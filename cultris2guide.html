			<h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>There aren't many guides for <a href="http://gewaltig.net/cultris2.aspx">Cultris 2</a>.  As its name implies, it is 
			a Tetris-like cult game.  (Cult + Tetris = Cultris.  Genious, I know..)</p>
			
			<p>This guide will teach you how some important techniques that go into up-stacking, and are also useful in other 
			Tetris variant games.  However, since Cultris 2 has the absence of hold - and only one piece preview - this information 
			suddenly becomes more valuable.
			
			<h3>Cultris 2 Mechanics</h3>
			<p>First, it is important to note that Cultris games do not follow the same versus rules as other Tetris games. 
			This is the particular reason why the Cultris games stand out among the rest of the Tetris clones.  Consider 
			the following:</p>
			<p>ComboTimer = time you have to combo (in seconds)<br/>
			ComboCounter = combo strength (1 = weak combo, 10 = strong combo)</p>
			<p>The way you attack and defend is by making combos. The combo timer begins ticking the first line you clear when your 
			timer is at zero seconds. If your timer is not at zero seconds, then your combo counter goes up.  Clearing more lines at 
			once grants you more time to combo.<br/>Harddrop wiki explains this part well enough:</p>
			<p>Base(comboTimer) + NumberOfLinesCleared * Bonus(comboCounter)</p>

			<b>Combo-time example:</b><br/>
			If you start a combo with a Single (counter=1), then you begin with 2.4 + 1 * 1.2 = 3.6 seconds combo-time.<br/>
			If you start a combo with a Tetris (counter=1), then you begin with 2.4 + 4 * 1.2 = 7.2 seconds combo-time.<br/>
			If this is followed up by a Single (counter=2), then you gain 1.1 + 1 * 0.6 = 1.7 seconds additional combo-time.<br/>
			If this is followed up by a Tetris (counter=2), then you gain 1.1 + 4 * 0.6 = 3.5 seconds additional combo-time.<br/>
			If you start with a Single followed by a Tetris, then you are rewarded with 3.6 + 3.5 = 7.1 seconds combo-time.<br/>
			If you start with a Tetris followed by a Single, then you are rewarded with 7.2 + 1.7 = 8.9 seconds combo-time.<br/>
			In both examples 5 lines were cleared, but the rewarded time is different.<br/>
			Try to start a combo with a multi-line clear, but avoid them in the later course of a combo.<br/>

			<h3>How to stack safely</h3>
			<p>As mentioned before, in Cultris games you cannot hold and you only get 1 piece preview.  Consider these stacks:<br/><br/>
			<img class="cultris" src="imgs/cultris2/stack.png">
			<br/>
			The reason why the stack on the left is a bad stack is because it doesn't allow for easy down-stacking and there isn't much 
			combo potential.  The stack on the right however, allows for any piece to be used to clear lines.  A good player can raise 
			their combo counter higher than 10 with the stack on the right.</br><br/>
			</p>

			
			<h3>Stacking tips</h3>
			<p>So you stacked 2-wide (2 columns left open) and now you want to setup your Tetris.  Here's how you can do it:<br/><br/>
			<img class="cultris" src="imgs/cultris2/2wide.png"><br/>
			This works with J-piece, L-piece, and T-piece.<br/></p>
			
			<p>Now you want to fix your 3rd column.  There's a method for that too!<br/><br/>
			<img class="cultris" src="imgs/cultris2/3wide.png"><br/>
			This strategy works with the J-piece and L-piece, but it is not as effective with the T-piece, as the T-piece will increase your 
			2nd column height by 1 and will leave you an overhang.<br/></p>
			
			<p>There will be times where you get an onslaught of s-pieces or z-pieces and you will have no choice but to 
			drop it in your well.  This will result in your stack looking like this:<br/><br/>
			<img class="cultris" src="imgs/cultris2/fixwell.png"><br/>
			TA-DAA!! Now you have a Tetris setup!</p>
			
			<h3>Closing comments</h3>
			<p>I hope this guide was of some use to some people.  Up-stacking can be pretty difficult in Cultris 2 
			given the absence of hold and being limited to one piece preview.  This is it for now, but make sure to 
			check out <a href="https://harddrop.com/wiki/Cultris_II">Harddrop's</a> in-depth guide on Cultris 2.  It 
			goes into detail with the piece randomizer, twists, and much more!
